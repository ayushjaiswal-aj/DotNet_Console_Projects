Write a program to calculate the cost of the stall based on its type. 
If the stall type is Gold, the cost will be Rs.100 per square feet. 
If the stall type is Diamond, the cost will be Rs.150 per square feet and 
cost of a TV will be Rs.100. 
If the stall type is Platinum, the cost will be Rs.200 per square feet 
and if they are using projector it will cost Rs.1000.
 

[Note :  Strictly adhere to the object-oriented specifications given as a part of the problem statement.
Follow the naming conventions as mentioned. Create separate classes in separate files.]

Consider the class named Stall and define the following methods.

Method	Description
public void ComputeCost(string _stallType, int _squareFeet)	This method is used to calculate the cost of the Gold stall on cost of Rs.100 per square feet
public void ComputeCost(string _stallType, int _squareFeet, int _numberOfTV)	This method is used to calculate the cost of the Diamond stall on cost of Rs.150 per square feet and cost per TV of Rs.100
public void ComputeCost(string _stallType, int _squareFeet, bool _projectorAvailability)	This method is used to calculate the cost of the Platinum stall on cost of Rs.200 per square feet and if they are using projector it costs Rs.1000

Consider the class Program and write a Main method to test the above class.

In Main method, get the stall type and its corresponding stall details from the user and calculate the cost.
